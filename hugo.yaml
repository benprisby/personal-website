    title: About Me
    image: images/about.jpg
    content: |-
      Welcome! I designed this site to showcase both my technical and non-technical sides, which more often than not
      intertwine.

      I've spent the last six years at Desktop Metal building software that powers industrial 3D printers, enabling mass
      manufacturing of everything from automotive parts to medical devices. What fascinates me most is the challenge of
      making complex systems feel simple and intuitive.

      During my time at DM, my proudest technical achievement is the Maxwell platform: the unified software foundation
      that lets our small team support an expanding, diverse product portfolio without sacrificing quality (or sanity).
      I also have a niche for creating embedded user interfaces that make our devices easy to use.

      Outside of work, I'm constantly experimenting. My homelab is where I prototype ideas and stay current with
      technologies that pique my interest. I've been playing guitar since I was nine and it continues to be my favorite
      creative outlet, where I explore patterns and emotions through songwriting. And I've developed a passion for
      mixology; there's something deeply satisfying about balancing flavors and perfecting techniques. When I'm not
      crafting cocktails or diving into code, my wife and I are usually training our puppy Luna.

      Whether I'm architecting software, crafting a cocktail, or working out a chord progression, I'm drawn to the
      intersection of technical precision and creative expression. The best solutions often come from understanding both
      the system and the human experience within it.

            **Principal Software Engineer (May 2023 - Present)**

            I lead the development of Maxwell, the unified software platform that serves as the foundation for an
            expanding device portfolio. The platform's modular architecture enables our small team to efficiently scale
            across multiple product lines through service-oriented design. I serve as the primary technical advisor for
            device software strategy, leading cross-functional architecture decisions and mentoring the team.

            **Senior Software Engineer (Mar 2021 - May 2023)**

            This role marked my transition into device software architecture leadership. A key achievement was
            developing Remote Assist, a comprehensive support system that enabled remote troubleshooting capabilities,
            significantly reducing on-site service requirements and improving customer support efficiency. I expanded my
            technical scope across the full stack, implementing Qt-based user interfaces, Python backend services, and
            CI/CD pipeline improvements while collaborating with hardware, design, and support teams.

            **Embedded Software Engineer (Jan 2019 - Mar 2021)**

            Beginning my full-time career, I specialized in Qt application development and embedded Linux systems. I was
            entrusted with customer-facing interface design decisions, which developed my understanding of user
            experience considerations for high-value industrial equipment. During this period, I contributed to the
            architectural evolution from monolithic to modular system design, establishing foundational patterns that
            would later influence the Maxwell platform development.

            *Designed and implemented Studio Printer support systems while also overhauling firmware and QA*

            This experience provided my first exposure to industrial 3D printing technology and established the
            foundation for my subsequent full-time roles at Desktop Metal by completing my second Northeastern co-op
            there. I began by revamping firmware QA test suites and quickly progressed to implementing and maintaining
            new code in Studio technician tools. I also gained lower-level firmware development skills in an extensive
            toolchain migration.

            As I completed my bachelor's degree and this co-op, I gained more valuable software engineering experience
            in a fast-paced startup, picking up many technical and leadership skills as I prepared for full-time.

            *Developed embedded medical device software for home hemodialysis systems through full development
            lifecycle*

            In my first full-time software engineering role as part of the Northeastern co-op program, I learned
            foundations of sound software design, development practices, and tooling. It further emphasized the
            importance of reliability and safety in life-critical software design, where system failures are not
            acceptable.

            This experience opened my eyes to real-world embedded software engineering and validated my career path as I
            continued earning my bachelor's degree.
